# PyTorch-Breast-Cancer-Classification-and-IRIS-classification
This notebook is a project from IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer#courses ) course Introduction to Neural Networks and PyTorch (https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-networks-with-pytorch?specialization=ai-engineer) 
This notebook explains the use of Pytorch to perform classification tasks.
It firsts uses the breast cancer dataset and performs the classification, then it uses different numbers of hidden units and different optimizer to see the changes in the training accuracy and loss.
In the third excercise it utlizes IRIS dataset and perform a 3-way classification task using Pytorch.
